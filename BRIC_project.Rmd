# Data preparation

## 1 Save raw data and adjust date range

```{r}
#0 save raw data
BRIC.monthly.raw <- BRIC.monthly
BRIC.yearly.raw <- BRIC.yearly

#1 adjust date range (from July 1994 to December 2018)
#1.1 leave raw data with date adjustment
BRIC.monthly.withNA <- subset(BRIC.monthly.raw, Date >= "1994-06-30" & Date <= "2019-02-01")
BRIC.yearly.withNA <- subset(BRIC.yearly.raw, YEAR >= "1994" & YEAR <= "2019")
#1.2 working dataframe
BRIC.monthly <- subset(BRIC.monthly, Date >= "1994-06-30" & Date <= "2019-02-01")
BRIC.yearly <- subset(BRIC.yearly, YEAR >= "1994" & YEAR <= "2019")
```

## 2 BRIC.monthly data preparation
at this point of time the data sheet is still balanced, therefore we can use the shift function
```{r}
#add the lagged MV.USD (this is the MV.USD from the previous month) 
BRIC.monthly[, lag.value:=c(1, MV.USD[-.N]), by=Id]
# rename column to LMV.USD
colnames(BRIC.monthly)[14] <- "LMV.USD"
#delete entry for "1994-06-30" as lag-value is wrong and this data point not needed
BRIC.monthly <- subset(BRIC.monthly, Date >= "1994-07-29" & Date <= "2019-02-01")

# calculate MV.USD.June for every column
# help columns
BRIC.monthly[,month := month(Date)]
BRIC.monthly[,year := year(Date)]
BRIC.monthly[,hcjun := ifelse(month>=7,year,year-1)]
# MV.USD.June column
intermediate <- filter(BRIC.monthly,BRIC.monthly$month == 7)
# minimise for join
intermediate <- subset(intermediate, select = c("Id","LMV.USD","hcjun"))
colnames(intermediate)[2] <- "MV.USD.June"
BRIC.monthly <- subset(BRIC.monthly, select = c("Id","country","Date","MV","MV.USD","LMV.USD","RET","RET.USD","ym","hcjun","year","month"))
#delete na's, set 0 and calculate important values
# no RET.USD data, no MV or no LMV.USD
BRIC.monthly <- BRIC.monthly %>%
  drop_na(RET.USD,MV,MV.USD,LMV.USD)
intermediate <- intermediate %>%
  drop_na(MV.USD.June)
# inner join automatically deletes values where MV.USD.June is not available
BRIC.monthly <- inner_join(x = BRIC.monthly,y = intermediate, by = c("Id","hcjun"))
# order BRIC.monthly
BRIC.monthly <- subset(BRIC.monthly, select = c("Id","country","Date","MV","MV.USD","LMV.USD","MV.USD.June","RET","RET.USD","ym","hcjun","year","month"))
```

## 3 BRIC.yearly data preparation and value calculation
```{r}
#3.1 book value / equity and related
# delete rows with no WC03501 (Common equity)
BRIC.yearly <- BRIC.yearly %>%
  drop_na(WC03501)
# set WC03263 (deferred taxes) zero if NA
BRIC.yearly$WC03263 <- BRIC.yearly$WC03263 %>% replace_na(0)
# add column for BookValue (Hanauer 2020 calculation)
BRIC.yearly$BookValue <- BRIC.yearly$WC03501 + BRIC.yearly$WC03263
# delete rows with negative BookValue
BRIC.yearly <- BRIC.yearly[BRIC.yearly$BookValue >= 0,]

#3.2 total assets
# delete rows with no WC02999 (total assets)
BRIC.yearly <- BRIC.yearly %>%
  drop_na(WC02999)

#3.3 operating profits
# "To have a valid value, at least one of cost components cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses, or interest expense must be non-missing." (Hanauer, 2019, p. 284) --> if one of these values is missing, we must delete these rows WC01001,WC01051,WC01101,WC01251
# delete rows where ALL 4 columns are NA
BRIC.yearly <- filter(BRIC.yearly,!is.na(WC01001) | !is.na(WC01051) | !is.na(WC01101) | !is.na(WC01251))
# replace all na's in this 4 columns with 0
BRIC.yearly$WC01001 <- BRIC.yearly$WC01001 %>% replace_na(0)
BRIC.yearly$WC01051 <- BRIC.yearly$WC01051 %>% replace_na(0)
BRIC.yearly$WC01101 <- BRIC.yearly$WC01101 %>% replace_na(0)
BRIC.yearly$WC01251 <- BRIC.yearly$WC01251 %>% replace_na(0)
# calculate operating profits (Hanauer, 2019, p.284)
BRIC.yearly$OperatingProfits <- (BRIC.yearly$WC01001 - BRIC.yearly$WC01051 - BRIC.yearly$WC01101 - BRIC.yearly$WC01251)

# 3.4 minimise data frame
# for BRIC.yearly we keep: Id, country, ICBSUC, YEAR, BookValue, OperatingProfits and total assets
# Note: WC07201 is not used, as our MV should be the MV from the monthly data for 06.y !
BRIC.yearly <- subset(BRIC.yearly, select = c("Id","country","ICBSUC","YEAR","BookValue","OperatingProfits","WC02999"))
# last we rename WC02999 to total assets
colnames(BRIC.yearly)[7] <- "TotalAssets"
```

# 4 FF5FM Calculation
## 4.1 Adding the 1-m treasury rate to the monthly data
```{r}
# load data sheet from French's website
FFData <- read_csv("FF_Research_Data_5_Factors_2x3.CSV", 
     skip = 2)
# shorting data frame
one_m_tbill <- as.data.frame(FFData[c("X1","RF")][1:693,])
# adding a ym column to risk free rate data
one_m_tbill$ym<-as.yearmon(one_m_tbill$X1, "%Y %m")
#delete X1 column 
one_m_tbill <- subset(one_m_tbill,select = c("ym","RF"))
# merge risk-free rate (1 month treasury bill rate) with monthly data
BRIC.monthly <- left_join(x = BRIC.monthly, y = one_m_tbill, by = "ym")

# make rf column numeric
BRIC.monthly$RF <- as.numeric(BRIC.monthly$RF)

```

## 4.2 Calculate RMRF
```{r}
BRIC.monthly$RMRF <- BRIC.monthly$RET.USD - BRIC.monthly$RF
```

## 4.3 Determine size Breakpoints
```{r}
setorder(BRIC.monthly,Date,-MV.USD.June)
hlpvariable <-  BRIC.monthly[month==7 & !is.na(MV.USD.June),
                .(pf.size = ifelse((cumsum(MV.USD.June)/sum(MV.USD.June))>=0.9,"Small","Big"),Id),
                               by=year]

# Merge the size portfolio allocation back from July Y to June Y+1
BRIC.monthly.df <- merge(BRIC.monthly,hlpvariable,
                       by.x=c("hcjun","Id"),
                       by.y=c("year","Id"),
                       all.x=T)

# delete NA's (only about 1000 rows)
BRIC.monthly.df <- na.omit(panel_country,cols = "pf.size") 
```

## 4.4 Merge monthly and accounting (yearly) data
```{r}

BRIC.maindata <- inner_join(x = BRIC.monthly.df,y = BRIC.yearly, by = c("Id","hcjun"))


# Determine the B/M breakpoints based on big stocks only

# Merge the B/M portfolio allocation back from July Y to June Y+1
panel_country_new <- merge(panel_country_BM,hlpvariable2,
                       by.x=c("hcjun"),
                       by.y=c("year"),
                       all.x=T)

panel_country_new[ , pf.bm := ifelse(BM>bm_bb70,"High",ifelse((BM<=bm_bb70 & BM>bm_bb30),"Neutral",ifelse(BM<=bm_bb30,"Low",NA)))]

panel_country_new[, SIZE_VALUE := paste0(Size,".",pf.bm)]

# we used MV.USD instead of the lagged MV

portfolio_returns <- panel_country_new[!is.na(Size) & !is.na(pf.bm)] %>% # this operator nests functions
  group_by(Date,SIZE_VALUE) %>% # do "everything" for the groups specified here
  summarize(ret.port = weighted.mean(RET.USD,
                                     MV.USD)) %>% # vw returns using lagged mcap
  spread(SIZE_VALUE,ret.port) %>% # create one column for each group
  mutate(
    Small = (Small.High + Small.Neutral + Small.Low)/3, # just exemplary
    Big = (Big.High + Big.Neutral + Big.Low)/3,
    SMB = Small-Big,
    High = (Small.High + Big.High)/2,

*TO DO's*:

- Calculate Benchmark (market-cap weighted big stocks of the BRIC region)
- Calculate break points on big stocks
- decide on strategy and implement it
- calculate portfolio characteristics
- visualize and showcase strategy performance
- regress strategy PF on FF5FM and momentum for style exposure analysis
- Literature
- sorting A-shares ... how to identify them?

EDA

```{r}
# finding the number of NA values by column in the dataframe
BRIC.monthly %>% mutate_all(is.na) %>% summarize_all(sum)

```

To DO: compute correlations by sector (10 sectors)

```{r}
# regular correlation matrix of all (four) numeric attributes
cor(select(BRIC.static, where(is.numeric)))
```


**Some conventions:**

Characteristic should be calculated as in Hanauer & Lauterbach (2019) or in Hanauer (2020)

Big stocks should be defined as the biggest stocks which together account for 90% of a
country's aggregated market capitalization
Benchmark should be defined as the cap-weighted universe of big stocks
Returns should be in USD
Breakpoints (for Fama-French factors) should be calculated on big stocks (as in the
excursus) but both small and big stocks go into the factor calculation.

# Benchmark Calculation

```{r}
length(BRIC.static$Id)

length(BRIC.yearly$Id)

```

```{r}
# joining the monthly and the static dataframe by the Id column (retainig all rows of BRIC.yearly)
df_combined <- left_join(x=BRIC.monthly,y=BRIC.static,by="Id")


head(df_combined)



```

```{r}
summary(df_combined$MV.USD)
```


```{r}
## finding the number of NA values by column in the dataframe
BRIC.yearly %>% mutate_all(is.na) %>% summarize_all(sum)
```



```{r}
# markt cap (USD): WC07210

## finding the number of NA values by column in the dataframe
df_combined %>% mutate_all(is.na) %>% summarize_all(sum)
```




Idea: calculate 90% of the sum of all stock market caps per country as a time series
(store the result in a column )

```{r}
# Big stocks should be defined as the biggest stocks which together account for 90% of # a country's aggregated market capitalization


# grouping the mcap values of individual stocks by country
mcap_country <- df_combined %>%
  filter(df_combined$MV.USD != "NA") %>% 
  group_by(country.x, ym) 

# computing the sum of the individual stock's market caps by country
country_mcap <- mcap_country %>%
group_by(country.x, ym) %>%
    summarize(mc_sum = sum(MV.USD))

country_mcap


```

```{r}
summary(country_mcap$mc_sum[country_mcap$country.x == "BRA"])
summary(country_mcap$mc_sum[country_mcap$country.x == "RUS"])
summary(country_mcap$mc_sum[country_mcap$country.x == "IND"])
summary(country_mcap$mc_sum[country_mcap$country.x == "CHN"])
```

 
# RMW
profitability: OP/BE: Operating profits-to-book equity. We measure operating profits-to-book equity as in Fama and French (2015) as sales or revenues (WC01001) minus cost of goods sold (WC01051), minus selling, general, and administrative expenses (WC01101), minus interest expense (WC01251); all divided by book equity.

investment: As in Cooper et al. (2008), we measure asset growth in June of year y as the percentage change in total assets (WC02999) from fiscal year ending in calendar year y−2 to fiscal year ending in calendar year y−1.
